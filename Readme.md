## Usage

- Go to [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), register an application, click on "Bot" on the left and click on the "Reset Token" button to get the bot token
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/seriousm4x/discord-developer-badge/releases) and download the latest version for your system
- Run the bot with `./devbadge -t <your-token>`
- Click the link printed to the console and allow the bot to join your server
- Tell your friend (if you don't have any, lol, use your 2nd account) to use the new discord `/devbadge` command in your server where the bot joined. It won't work when you use the command with the same account as the bot is created with
- Check the page for [active developer](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer) and wait to redeem your badge. Discord can take a couple hours to activate your badge.
